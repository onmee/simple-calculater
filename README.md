# Simple Calculator
- Created using The Odin Project 'Calculator' assignment specifications.
- Add, subtract, multiply, and power functions.
- Only evalutes a pair of numbers at a time, but operations can be chained together, so *12 + 7 - 5 * 3 =42.*
- Calculation limited to what can be displayed -> around 14 numbers.
- AC resets the calculator and DEL remove the last number, as expected.
- Keyboard support for numbers and dot.
- Works best on **Chrome** and **Edge**.
